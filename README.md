# Bing Web Scraper in Go

This repository contains a simple Bing Web Scraper implemented in Go. The scraper fetches search results from Bing for a given query and parses the title, description, and URL of each result. It supports multiple pages, customizable result count per page, and optional proxy configuration.

## Features

- Fetch search results from Bing for a given query.
- Parse and extract result rank, title, description, and URL.
- Supports multiple pages and adjustable number of results per page.
- Includes optional proxy support for requests.
- Configurable backoff time between requests to avoid bans.

## Prerequisites

- Go installed on your machine (version 1.17 or higher recommended).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bing-web-scraper.git
    cd bing-web-scraper
    
    ```
    
2. Install dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    
    ```
    

## Usage

The main entry point for the scraper is the `BingScrape` function, which takes the following parameters:

- `searchTerm` (string): The search query.
- `country` (string): Bing country code (e.g., `com`, `uk`, `in`).
- `proxyString` (interface{}): Optional proxy configuration (e.g., a string for proxy URL).
- `pages` (int): Number of pages to scrape.
- `count` (int): Number of results per page.
- `backoff` (int): Time (in seconds) to wait between requests.

### Example

Here's an example usage from the `main` function:

```go
func main() {
    res, err := BingScrape("Karthik H nair", "com", nil, 2, 10, 0)
    if err != nil {
        log.Println("Error in BingScrape")
    }

    for _, value := range res {
        fmt.Println(value)
        fmt.Println()
    }
}

```

This will fetch search results for the query `Karthik H nair` from Bing's US website (`.com`) for 2 pages with 10 results per page.
